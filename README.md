# Gophers Doing (vibe-code) Experiments

This is just a toy experiment with [ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/), a 2D game engine for Go. This compiles to WASM and then runs in any browser.
The goal of this was to see how easy it'd be to implement using OpenAI's
ChatGPT Plus (`GPT-4o`, `o3`, `o4-mini-high`) and free Claude Sonnet 4.

ChatGPT Plus (all models), unfortunately failed this task horribly and completely.
Claude Sonnet 4 actually managed to pull it off after several attempts.

## Development

Run `make runbrowser` to build and open in a browser.
